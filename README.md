# FSOD_datasets

This repository contains scripts used for processing datasets for Few-Shot Object/Defect Detection. The datasets include COCO, Visdrone, Steel defects (NEU-DET dataset), and Wood defects dataset.

The scripts handle the following tasks:

- Downloading the datasets
- Converting into YOLO or COCO format
- Splitting datasets into 10-shot contexts
- Augmentations
- Visualizing bounding boxes

This repository also provides the configuration files in the YOLO format.
